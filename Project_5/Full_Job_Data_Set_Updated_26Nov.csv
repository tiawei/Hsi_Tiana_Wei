Simply Apply...need more?...Want to know who we are?
We're a young startup, with a bold AND ambitious AND realistic goal: make health professionals adopt telemedicine with bliss.
It all started 2 years ago, when two out-of-residency dermatologists (Emilie and Marc-André) and Marc-André's brother (Jean-Philippe) decided there had to be a better way to care for patients. They looked around and found no such solution, so they stitched up their own. Piece by piece, they built something they could love: Dermago (dermago.ca) a modern virtual dermatology clinic. For a time, it was enough.But one day, a private clinic approached them to ask if they could, too, use it to enter the modern age. Of course they said! yes! And Dermago grew, a bit. And then another asked. And then another. So they started to grow, more steadily each time.
But then, COVID happened and they were flooded with demands. They sat down with a consultant, asked for advice and brainstormed. Quickly, the answer was obvious: build a technology company and take all that they had learned over the last two years to build a customizable, secure, private, smart, user and doctor friendly, modern, reasonably-priced telemedicine platform.
And that's what you, as a part of the Technology team, will build!

...What kind of person we need, you ask?
passionate about software and how magic it can become in the right hands: yours!
driven to make software and data science/machine learning both efficient, privacy-aware and ethic
inclined to use, participate and maybe contribute in open-source technologies and their ecosystem
entry-level or junior is ok, if you have made something worth talking about: don't be shy, show us!
for the more experienced, the bar will be as high as you can make it: we're a small team (for now) so, no mental shackles and asking if you can. just. do. it.

...What Tiks our Toks? how do you fit?
we do modern telemedicine, so yeah, we are modern: remote work, cloud technologies, recent languages, Agility, DevOps and best software practices are our bread and butter. If you like to do COBOL on a mainframe, we respect that. But our joy will be different.
we have the customers, the doctors love us, but we need to build the best platform for them: so better be unafraid to try stuff, write an amazing React component, scratch it for a Svelte one, or fall back on doing it server side. The craft never stops. We'll be learning every day.
we're just starting but still, our team is strong: from the technology to our product, marketing and advisors, we look for the best or we coach, mentor and grow them, prepare to become world-class, if you already are, prepare to redefine what it means  

...Curious about the challenges? Come tackle those:
our platform sustains all legal requirement you can throw at it: PEPIDA, HiPaa, GDPR. For us it's a baseline, we sleep soundly when the patient and doctor are the only ones to access records
ain't no time to wait for the page to refresh: doctors and patients need it to be easy, reactive and pleasant
data grows fast, models need to be retrained, answers still need to be given in a timely manner: it is local but we will scale, prepare the Terabyte SSD
some of our users will prefer to look it up quickly on their smartwatch, other will want to be at a desk to think about it: we don't stop at any device, we serve all, whatever the format

...So what's success?
Elbow-hugs if you like them (it's a COVID thing now), or just hand-washed high-fives
Simple ""Thank you""s or big gesture, a startup can lead to big rewards too
Your family or friends asking you if the fantastic platform they used to care for the health of a loved one is the thing you're working on
happy doctors and happy nurses, which means happy patients, which means healthy people! everybody wins

...Stuff that will help you succeed as a Full Stack team member?
Having done something, even if it's a spectacular university work you're proud of, we're sure there's a reason why
Strong NodeJS and/or Rust knowledge, maybe not a ""Senior"" yet, but you know when it make sense to reduce()
Not afraid of digging into the services: whether they're micro or macro, you know to hug them tight
Love and hate for at least one framework
Familiar with cloud environments and tools, preferably AWS or GCP, with a taste for their PaaS and FaaS offering  
Knowledgeable into the Unix toolchain, even if you're a Windows user, your heart has the shape of a penguin
Biased toward modern software practices: CI/CD, BDD or DDD are not just letters to you
Unafraid to dabble in front-end code if, as long as its modern, it's not sorcery anyway
Master or at least soon-to-be of everything-API: REST, GraphQL, maybe some SOAP, you like them all
Master of at least one cloud storage options: object, block, file storage, databases (SQL, NoSQL, analytics, graph, time-series), caches, one of them you're a ninja of

...Remote? Benefits?
When it comes to where you should live, the more talented and experienced you are and the less we care. Why? Because when you start you career, we believe you should be nearer you peers, be able to sit physically down with them and get the 60% of communication you don't get using Zoom. 
We do have some rule of thumb though: 
Be ± 3 hours timezone-wise
Speak English and/or French. Only english is fine. 
 In Canada. Outside of that, the administrative and tax complication are too much (for now
Ask for ou benefits package, this is already too long... :)

...besoin de plus d'infos?...Qui on est?
Nous sommes une jeune startup avec un plan ambitieux ET réaliste: rendre l'adoption de la télémédecine par les professionnels de santé un bonheur.
Tout a commencé il y a 2 ans, quand 2 dermatologues ayant terminé leur résidence (Émilie et Marc-André) discutent avec le frère de Marc-André (Jean-Philippe) pour trouver une meilleure façon de prendre soin de leurs patients. Ils cherchent, mais ne trouvent rien qu'ils voudraient utiliser pour eux. Ils decident alors d'assembler quelque chose par eux-même. Pièce par pièce, ils rapiècent une application qu'ils commencent à aimer : Dermago (http://dermago.ca), une clinique de dermatologie virtuelle moderne. Et pour un temps, ca leur suffit. Mais quelques mois plus tard, une clinique privée les approche pour savoir s'ils peuvent, eux aussi, l'utiliser. Biensur, ils répondent ! Évidement ! Et Dermago grandit. Un peu. Puis, une autre clinique de super-infirmière fait la meme demande. Et une autre...Et Dermago grossit, de façon plus soutenu a chaque fois.
Un jour, COVID arrive. A partir de là, ils se retrouvent à deux doigts d'être débordé par les demandes. Ils cherchent conseil auprès d'experts sur la stratégie et de conseillers en croissance. Après un temps de reflexion pour s'accorder sur ce qu'ils veulent vraiment construire, ils tombent sur la réponse la plus évidente: une compagnie de technologie qui incorporerait tout ce qu'ils ont appris pour livrer un plateforme de télémédecine moderne, personnalisable, sécurisée, abordable, intelligente, protectrice à l'extreme des données personnelles et avec une experience Docteur-Patient de rêve. 
Et ca, c'est la plateforme que tu vas construire avec le reste de l'équipe technique!

...Quel genre de personnes on cherche, tu te demandes?
avant tout, passionnée( e ) par le logiciel et ce qu'il peut faire entre les bonnes mains: les tiennes!!
poussée( e )  par le désir de faire de la programmation et de la science des données aussi efficace, respectueuse de la vie privée qu'éthique
biaisée( e ) dans l'utilisation, la participation et peut-être meme la contribution aux communautés open-source et leur écosystème
débutante( e ) c'est ok, si tu as une réalisation dont ca vaut la peine de parler ensemble: soit pas timide, montres nous!
pour les plus expérimentées( e ), la barre est placée aussi haute que tu la met: on est une petite équipe (pour commencer) donc aucune barrières mentales et besoin de demander l'autorisation. just. do. it.

...Qu'est ce qui Tiques nos Toques? ...ou tu fit?
on fait de la télémédecine moderne, donc ouais, on est moderne: télétravail, infonuagique, des languages récents, l'Agilité, DevOps et les meilleures pratiques disponibles sont notre pain quotidien. Si tu aimes faire du COBOL sur des mainframes, respect. Mais notre plaisir sera ailleurs.
on a déjà des clients, nos docteurs nous aiment, mais on a besoin de construire une plateforme qui dépasse leurs attentes: alors c'est mieux si t'as pas peur d'essayer des trucs, écrire un composant React impressionnant, le mettre à la poubelle pour le remplacer par une version Svelte, ou finalement le faire coté serveur. La recherche de la meilleure solution ne s'arrête jamais. Du nouveau chaque jour. 
on fait que commencer, mais notre équipe est déjà remplie de superstars: de la technologies aux produits, le marketing ou nos conseillers, on trouve les meilleurs où on les coach et mentor pour le devenir : prepare toi à devenir de niveau mondial, ou si tu l'es déjà, à redéfinir ce que ça veux dire

...Curieux sur nos challenges? Viens donc résoudre ca:
notre plateforme supporte toutes les exigences légale que tu peux lui balancer: PEPIDA, HiPaa, GDPR. Pour nous, c'est une baseline : on dort comme des bébés toutes les nuits, sachant que les données de santé des gens sont accessible juste à eux et leurs professionnels de santé
ain't no time for that! d'attendre que la page rafraichisse: nos Docteurs et nos Patients ont une experience facile, étonnement réactive et plaisante, on parle cache
les données ça pousse sur les disques durs comme des champignons, les modèles ça a besoin d'être mis a jour comme un Windows sans anti-virus, mais les réponses doivent quand même arriver à temps: c'est local mais ca doit scaler, prepares ton SSD
certains préfèrent avoir leur réponse rapidement sur leur montre, d'autres sur leur ordinateur de bureau: aucun appareil ne nous arrête, on sert tout le monde, dans tous les formats 

...Ok, c'est quoi le succès chez vous alors?
Des bises de coudes si vous aimez ca (c'est un truc de COVID), ou juste des high-five avec les mains pleines d'antiseptique
Un simple ""Merci"" ou des grands gestes, une startup peut aussi donner des grosses récompenses
Votre famille ou amis qui vous demande si l'extraordinaire plateforme qu'ils ont utilisés pour prendre soin d'un proche c'est ça, votre job?
des docteurs et des infirmières heureuses, ce qui veut dire des patients heureux, ce qui veux dire des gens en santé! Tout le monde y gagne

...Qu'est que ca prend pour réussir comme Full Stack?
Au moins une réalisation dont tu es fière( e ), même si c'est ""juste"" des travaux pratiques d'université, c'est certain que t'en as d'autre à venir
Profonde connaissance de NodeJS et/ou Rust, t'es peut être pas ""Senior"" mais tu sais quand reduce()
Prêt a plonger dans les services: qu'ils soient micro ou macro, tu sais comment les garder en controle
Amour et haine d'au moins 1 framework
Grande familiarité avec les environments et outils cloud (infonuagique), de préférence AWS ou GCP, avec un gout pour leur offre PaaS et FaaS  
Praticien des outils Unix et de la ligne de commande, meme si ton desktop est Windows, ton coeur bat pour un pingouin 
Biaisé en faveur des pratiques modernes de programmation: CI/CD, BDD ou DDD ne sont pas juste des lettres pour toi
Confiant de modifier du code de back-end que ce soit Node ou autre, c'est pas de la sorcellerie anyway
Maitre, ou proche de l'être, de tout ce parle API: REST, GraphQL, peut-être SOAP, tu les aimes toutes
Maitre d'au moins un système de sauvegarde: stockage d'objet, de bloque, de fichiers, bases de données (SQL, NoSQL, analytique, graphe, series temporelle), caches, tu es un ninja pour l'un d'eux

...Remote? Avantage sociaux?
Quand on parle de ou vous devriez habiter, le plus talentueux vous êtes, le moins ca nous concerne. Pourquoi? Parce qu'on pense que lorsque vous commencez votre carrière de développeur, pouvoir s'asseoir dans la meme pièce et avoir les 60% de la communication qui manque sur Zoom est essentielle.
Pour le reste, nous avons quelques règles:
à ±3 heures de notre fuseau horaires
Parler Anglais et/ou Français.
Au Canada. En dehors, les complications administratives et de taxe sont (pour l'instant) trop
Sinon pour les avantages, appliquez et demandez, cette annonce est deja trop longue :)
N.B.: Veuillez noter que la forme féminine est utilisée dans le seul but de montrer aux fantastiques ingénieures qu'on vous veut fort, ainsi que toute ( e ) membre de toute minorité, majorité et communauté, on veux du talent! Donnez nous du talent!

320,Channel Marketing Manager - Canada,"Victoria, British Columbia","Do you ever feel like you’re a small cog in a large machine, struggling to make a meaningful impact? Or perhaps you’ve been dreaming of big, innovative ideas but haven’t quite had the resources to make them a reality?
We believe that NetMotion sits in that sweet spot in between the two, and that it truly offers the best of both worlds. As one of the Northwest US’ most ambitious scale-ups, NetMotion is well funded and built on almost two decades of world-leading technology that over a million people rely on each day. It’s also an environment small and agile enough to offer you all kinds of opportunity to flex your creative and strategic muscles, allowing you to make a meaningful contribution to the future of the company.
What We’re Looking For:
We’re on the lookout for someone bold, energetic, and smart to lead our channel marketing function. If you’ve got the hustle and skillset to take on that challenge, and the idea of having a central role in the growth of a thriving tech company appeals to you, then we’d love it if you got in touch.
This role reports directly to the Sr. Manager of Marketing and involves working closely alongside the rest of the marketing and channel teams.
Here’s what you can expect from the role:
Manage and execute on a global strategy that strengthens the relationship with our key channel partners, such as AT&T, Verizon, Telstra and CDW.
Find ways to generate business and build links with our wider pool of partners, coming up with new tactics that resonate with our resellers and their customers.
Manage a significant worldwide budget to execute compelling campaigns, engaging events and inventive incentives.
Produce tailored materials that intelligently articulate the NetMotion value proposition to a wide array of partners and resellers.

Drive the onboarding and recruitment of new partners, creating clever comarketing plans that are able to scale
 
Your Skills: 
A good amount of experience working in the intersection between vendors and resellers. That might be working for a carrier managing relationships with other partners. It could also be at a VAR, distributor or MSP. The best of all would be history working at a technology company in a channel role, of course.
Hands-on capabilities when it comes to putting on killer events (virtual and in-person). That means strong organizational skills and an ability to work well with others (internally & externally).
Familiarity with writing or in content production, whether that’s a stint producing razor-sharp marketing copy or time spent writing incisive longform articles.
A general comfort with numbers and what they mean to a marketer. You don’t have to be a data scientist or analytics pro, but a working knowledge of ROI and how to navigate a spreadsheet is pretty important.
A natural ability to improvise and hustle. Of course, you’ll get tons of support and mentorship, but we love people that can work autonomously and understand how their work plays into the wider goals of the business.
 
Why You’ll Love It Here:
Competitive benefits program, a Group RRSP plan, fitness and commuting allowances
Flexible working from home policy
Flexible vacation policy, 12 company paid holidays, 10 paid sick days, and paid parental leave

342,Channel Marketing Manager - Canada,Toronto,"Do you ever feel like you’re a small cog in a large machine, struggling to make a meaningful impact? Or perhaps you’ve been dreaming of big, innovative ideas but haven’t quite had the resources to make them a reality?
We believe that NetMotion sits in that sweet spot in between the two, and that it truly offers the best of both worlds. As one of the Northwest US’ most ambitious scale-ups, NetMotion is well funded and built on almost two decades of world-leading technology that over a million people rely on each day. It’s also an environment small and agile enough to offer you all kinds of opportunity to flex your creative and strategic muscles, allowing you to make a meaningful contribution to the future of the company.
What We’re Looking For:
We’re on the lookout for someone bold, energetic, and smart to lead our channel marketing function. If you’ve got the hustle and skillset to take on that challenge, and the idea of having a central role in the growth of a thriving tech company appeals to you, then we’d love it if you got in touch.
This role reports directly to the Sr. Manager of Marketing and involves working closely alongside the rest of the marketing and channel teams.

Your Skills: 
A good amount of experience working in the intersection between vendors and resellers. That might be working for a carrier managing relationships with other partners.

This is done using a vendor product and is implemented on the bank hosted infrastructure.  The need for this came about because Nostros balances are reported on a T+1 basis forcing the bank to take a reactive approach to rectify accounts that are in a short position. There is significant credit risk resulting from late incoming payments from counterparts or clients with no clear way to identify these payments in a timely manner. The interest costs incurred on a yearly basis are significant and there is an opportunity to create a proactive process that will allow the bank to remediate on a same day (T) basis.  The application would provide real-time monitoring of these accounts, gave insight into future cost savings and provide a basis for future compliance to regulators should the need arise and mitigate credit risk by tracking payment trends. It also allowed for predicting payment behaviour with respect to the Nostro accounts  Candidate Value Proposition: The successful candidate will have an opportunity to work closely with senior developers to understand multiple languages in various departments. The main function of a Technical Analyst is to plan, design, develop and implement efficient business and operations systems in support of core organizational functions and business processes.
