This is done using a vendor product and is implemented on the bank hosted infrastructure.  The need for this came about because Nostros balances are reported on a T+1 basis forcing the bank to take a reactive approach to rectify accounts that are in a short position. There is significant credit risk resulting from late incoming payments from counterparts or clients with no clear way to identify these payments in a timely manner. The interest costs incurred on a yearly basis are significant and there is an opportunity to create a proactive process that will allow the bank to remediate on a same day (T) basis.  The application would provide real-time monitoring of these accounts, gave insight into future cost savings and provide a basis for future compliance to regulators should the need arise and mitigate credit risk by tracking payment trends. It also allowed for predicting payment behaviour with respect to the Nostro accounts  Candidate Value Proposition: The successful candidate will have an opportunity to work closely with senior developers to understand multiple languages in various departments.
