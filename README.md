# My programming experience in Python

This website showcase multiple projects I have worked on for a data science course (MIE1624) provided by the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at University of Toronto.

Each project demonstrates a list of corresponding skills and links to a Python notebook detailing each step of the analysis.

## [Project 1: Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge - 1](https://github.com/tiawei/tiawei.github.io/blob/main/Project_1/wei_Kaggle%20ML%26DS%20Survey%20Challenge_1.ipynb)
Dataset reference: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data>

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Basic statisitcal analysis
- Data visualization

## [Project 2: Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge - 2](https://github.com/tiawei/tiawei.github.io/blob/main/Project_2/wei_Kaggle%20ML%26DS%20Survey%20Challenge_2.ipynb)

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning (handle missing data, data encoding, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis and feature selection
- Model implementation (model fitting and cross-validation)
- Model tuning (performance matrix assessment and hyperparameter tuning)
- Model assessment

## [Project 3: Natural language processing for 2020 US election prediction](https://github.com/tiawei/tiawei.github.io/blob/main/Project_3/wei_NLP_for_2020_US_election_prediction.ipynb)

Skills demonstrated:
- Text data cleaning and processing
- Feature engineering (Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, etc.)
- Multiple classification algorithms (logistic regression, k-NN, Naive
Bayes, SVM, decision trees, ensembles (RF,XGBoost))
- Model implementation and tuning

## [Project 4: COVID19 modeling (Ontario, Canada)](https://github.com/tiawei/tiawei.github.io/blob/main/Project_4/wei_COVID19_modeling.ipynb)

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning, exploratation, and visualization
- SIR model fitting
- Identifying factors driving COVID19
- Model-informed insights on battling COVID19 
- Real-life application of modeling skills

## [Project 5: Data driven curriculum design in Data Science](https://github.com/tiawei/tiawei.github.io/blob/main/Project_5/Final_notebook%20Group%203%20project.ipynb)
(Group project collaborated with Kamal Al-Mukhalalaty, Yunpiao Bai, Sheldon Barretto, Josh Paciocco, and Xuguang Wang)

Skills demonstrated (my contribution):
