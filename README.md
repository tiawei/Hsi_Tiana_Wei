# Demonstration of my programming experience in Python

This repository includes multiple projects I have worked on for a data science course (MIE1624) provided by the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at University of Toronto.

## Project 1: Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge - 1
Dataset reference: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data>

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Basic statisitcal analysis
- Data visualization

## Project 2: Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge - 2

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning (handle missing data, data encoding, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis and feature selection
- Model implementation (model fitting and cross-validation)
- Model tuning (performance matrix assessment and hyperparameter tuning)
- Model assessment

## Project 3: Natural language processing for 2020 US election prediction

Skills demonstracted:
- Text data cleaning and processing
- Feature engineering (Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, etc.)
- Multiple classification algorithms (logistic regression, k-NN, Naive
Bayes, SVM, decision trees, ensembles (RF,XGBoost))
- Model implementation and tuning

## Project 4: COVID19 modeling (Ontario, Canada)

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning, exploratation, and visualization
- SIR model fitting
- Identifying factors driving COVID19
- Model-informed insights on battling COVID19 
- Real-life application of modeling skills

## Project 5: Data driven curriculum design in Data Science
(Group project collaborated with Kamal Al-Mukhalalaty, Yunpiao Bai, Sheldon Barretto, Josh Paciocco, and Xuguang Wang)

Skills demonstrated (my contribution):
- Web-scraping
- Data visualization
- Text analysis
